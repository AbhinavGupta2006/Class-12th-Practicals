(done)1.	Write a program in Python to create a stack name StackVow, which takes the elements as vowels and implement all oprations (Push, POP and Traversal) on stack StackVow

(done)2.	Write a program in python to create a stack “student” with details of student name and their marks. Write Operation for Push, Pop and Traversal operation using menu.

(done)3.	Julie has created a dictionary containing names and marks as key value pairs of 6 students. Write a program, with separate user defined functions to perform the following operations: ● Push the keys (name of the student) of the dictionary into a stack, where the corresponding value (marks) is greater than 75. ● Pop and display the content of the stack. For example: If the sample content of the dictionary is as follows:
R={"OM":76, "JAI":45, "BOB":89, "ALI":65, "ANU":90, "TOM":82} 
The output from the program should be: TOM ANU BOB OM
